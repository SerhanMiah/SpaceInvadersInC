# Project - Space Invader  in C#




## Project Overview

This project aims to create a classic Space Invaders game using C#, WPF, System.Windows, System.Drawing, and DispatcherTimer. The game demonstrates building a simple yet engaging game using C# and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for the user interface. The game includes essential features such as player and enemy movement, shooting, collision detection, and score tracking.

The Space Invaders game is built using the following key components:

GameObject Class: This is the base class representing all game objects, including player ships, enemy ships, and bullets. It includes common properties and methods such as position, dimensions, image, and basic methods for updating and rendering.

PlayerShip Class: This class represents the player's ship, inheriting from the GameObject class. It is responsible for managing the player's movement and shooting.

EnemyShip Class: This class represents the enemy ships, also inheriting from the GameObject class. It is responsible for managing enemy movement patterns and shooting.

Bullet Class: This class represents bullets fired by both the player and enemies, inheriting from the GameObject class. It is responsible for bullet movement and checking for collisions with other game objects.

GameState Class: This class is responsible for managing the game's overall state, including player and enemy ships, bullets, score, and game over status.

MainWindow Class: This class represents the main user interface of the game. It handles user input, updates the game state, and redraws game objects on the screen. It also manages the game loop using a DispatcherTimer, which ensures that the game runs smoothly and updates at a consistent rate.

Direction Enum: This enumeration is used to represent the possible movement directions for game objects, such as player ships and enemy ships.

By combining these components, the project provides a complete and functional Space Invaders game that can be played on a Windows computer using the keyboard to control the player's movement and shooting. The game tracks the player's score, which increases as the player destroys enemy ships, and displays a "Game Over" message when the player loses all lives or the enemies reach the bottom of the screen.


## The Brief



## Technologies used:

### Front end:
* WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
* XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language)
* System.Windows.Shapes
* System.Windows.Media
 ### Back end:
* C#
* System.Drawing
* System.Windows.Threading
### Dev Tools:
* Visual Studio
* .NET Framework
* Git
* GitHub
* Windows OS
* Microsoft Developer documentation
* Stack Overflow (for troubleshooting and support)

Note: In the case of the Space Invader game in C# using WPF, the front end and back end are closely tied together since it's a standalone desktop application. Thus, the front end and back end technologies are mostly integrated.
